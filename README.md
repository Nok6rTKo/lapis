## Why was Lapis created?

Lapis was co-created by [Ruri](https://github.com/bewizible) and [kuri](https://github.com/donkuri/) to provide an alternative to the Anki notetype both were using at the time, [Aquafina](https://github.com/Aquafina-water-bottle) and later [arbyste](https://github.com/arbyste/)'s [jp-mining-note](https://arbyste.github.io/jp-mining-note-prerelease/) (abbreviated JPMN henceforth). While this note is fantastic and was a major inspiration for Lapis, we had the following issues with it:

1. The note relied on custom handlebars, many of which are now directly implemented in Yomitan.
2. The heavy amount of JavaScript on the card caused noticeable lag on mobile devices.
3. Its dependency on handlebars meant it wasn’t compatible with tools that don’t support Yomitan or handlebars directly, like [JL](https://github.com/rampaa/JL).
4. While uncommon, the use of custom handlebars and CSS to format definitions meant it sometimes would break dictionary formatting.
6. The source code was auto-generated, making it a real challenge for both developers and non-developers alike to read and customize.
7. The original developer of the note sadly went MIA in the summer of 2023, leaving Arbyste alone to understand the codebase and fix potential issues. While Arbyste has done outstanding work, no further development is planned except for bug fixing.

At the same time, another great notetype caught our eyes, [rudnam](https://github.com/rudnam)'s excellent [JP-study](https://github.com/rudnam/JP-study). **Lapis was made to take the best of both worlds and avoid the issues mentioned above**. Ruri focused on the technical side of the project, writing the code and building the note, while kuri helped design the note, gave feedback and led the project. **We welcome new contributors!**

## Key features

- This card **doesn’t rely on custom handlebars** at all, meaning it fully supports every Japanese dictionary that Yomitan does, and the chance of something breaking is exceptionally rare.  
- You can easily select different types of cards using the `Is...Card` selectors. To do this, simply add an 'x' to the "Is...Card" field of your choice. Make sure to only select one of these. If you ever need to switch card types for many notes at once, you can use [Batch Editing](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/291119185) to make the change quickly.
- Lapis uses harmonic frequency ranking to create a `FrequencySort` field you can use to re-order your new cards by frequency, either manually by using [Advanced Browser](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/874215009), or automatically with [AutoReorder](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/757527607). **Do be careful with the latter as there have been cases where AutoReorder has reset learned cards to 'new'.**
- Lapis allows you to organizes dictionaries into different fields, making it easier to view information in an organized manner. You can easily choose which dictionaries you'd like to see first, more details [below](#how-to-use-the-card).

## How to use Lapis

To use Lapis, first download the example deck from [Releases](https://github.com/donkuri/lapis/releases). From there, you need to change your fields settings in Yomitan. Start by selecting `Lapis` as the `Model` in Yomitan's `Configure Anki Card Format`. Here is how your fields should be set up:

| Field              | Value                                              |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Expression         | `{expression}`                                     |
| ExpressionFurigana | `{furigana-plain}`                                 |
| ExpressionReading  | `{reading}`                                        |
| ExpressionAudio    | `{audio}`                                          |
| SelectionText      | `{popup-selection-text}`                           |
| MainDefinition     | Something like `{single-glossary-jmdict/jitendex}` |
| Sentence           | `{cloze-prefix}<b>{cloze-body}</b>{cloze-suffix}`  |
| SentenceFurigana   |                                                    |
| SentenceAudio      |                                                    |
| Picture            |                                                    |
| Glossary           | `{glossary}`                                       |
| Hint               |                                                    |
| IsHintCard         |                                                    |
| IsClickCard        |                                                    |
| IsSentenceCard     |                                                    |
| PitchPosition      | `{pitch-accent-positions}`                         |
| Frequency          | `{frequencies}`                                    |
| FreqSort           | `{frequency-harmonic-rank}`                        |
| MiscInfo           |                                                    |

## FAQ

### How do I setup AJT Japanese to work with Lapis?

Please refer to [this](docs/anki_setup.md)

### What's Anki? What's mining? How do I mine with Lapis?

Please read the [guide](https://donkuri.github.io/learn-japanese/guide/). For mining, see the [mining setups](https://donkuri.github.io/learn-japanese/mining/).

### How do I use different card types?

The `is...Card` fields let you select the kind of card you want to use. Without anything, you get plain old vocab cards. Here are the possible options:

| Field selected        | Effect                                                                |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| isHintCard            | Uses the `Hint` field to give you a hint in the front of the card     |
| isClickCard           | Makes the word in the front of the card clickable to get the sentence |
| isSentenceCard        | The full sentence appears in the front instead of only the word       |

### What is the purpose of the three different fields for definitions?

This is partly inspired by JPMN and its method of organizing dictionaries. There are three main fields:

- `SelectionText` – Use this when you want to highlight a specific sentence or definition from the Yomitan popup. If you don’t need to highlight anything, just leave it empty, it won’t affect the notetype.
- `MainDefinition` – This is where you input the main dictionary you prefer. I highly recommend filling this in. If you're new to Japanese or mining on your own, it’s a good idea to start with a bilingual dictionary like JMDict/Jitendex. Alternatively, you can use your preferred monolingual dictionaries (such as 三省堂, 大辞林, 大辞泉...) by selecting them when configuring Yomitan. **Please note, the dictionaries need to be installed in Yomitan before they can be selected.**
- `Glossary` – This is where you place all of your dictionary definitions. We recommend having more than a single dictionary, see [here](https://donkuri.github.io/learn-japanese/setup/#adding-dictionaries). **If you choose to use only a single dictionary, make sure it is selected in `MainDefinition` and leave this field EMPTY to avoid a known bug.**

### I found a bug, where can I report it?

Open an issue and tell us about it on the [issue tracker](https://github.com/donkuri/lapis/issues), we will be more than happy to help you!

### There's a weird `yomitan` tag at the bottom of my card, what does this mean?

No worries! This is an easy fix. Just make sure that `Card tags` in your Yomitan settings is empty, as it is usually filled with `yomitan` by default, which causes this issue. The notetype displays all tags on the note at the bottom of the card, which can be useful for marking the source of the card. For example, the card in the example deck has the tag アニメ:小市民シリーズ at the bottom, indicating [the source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sh%C5%8Dshimin_Series). **These tags aren’t added automatically, you will need to apply them manually if you want them. If you don't apply any tag, nothing will be rendered at the bottom.** 

### How do I add a note to the card?

You can use the `MiscInfo` field to add any extra information you'd like. It will then appear at the bottom of the back of the card.

### What is `{frequency-harmonic-rank}` and why is it used in FreqSort?

For each card, `{frequency-harmonic-rank}` computes the [harmonic mean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmonic_mean) of all the frequencies on that card. It is often used when working with ratios and it approaches what the word's *true frequency* looks like.

### How can I change the font size for something?

To change the font size, open the `Styling` section of the card in Anki by going to `Browse`, then select a Lapis card and then click on `Cards` (top-left of the card editor). Once there, look for the section at the top labeled `/* PC Font sizes */` or `/* Mobile font sizes */`, which should look like this:

```css
  /* PC Font sizes */
  --pc-main-font-size: 16px;
  --pc-main-def-size: 20px;
  --pc-vocab-font-size: 85px;
  --pc-back-vocab-font-size: 60px;
  --pc-sentence-font-size: 52px;
  --pc-back-sentence-font-size: 35px;
  --pc-hint-font-size: 38px;
  --pc-info-font-size: 23px;

  /* Mobile font sizes */
  --mobile-main-font-size: 16px;
  --mobile-main-def-size: 16px;
  --mobile-vocab-font-size: 70px;
  --mobile-back-vocab-font-size: 32px;
  --mobile-sentence-font-size: 38px;
  --mobile-back-sentence-font-size: 24px;
  --mobile-hint-font-size: 24px;
  --mobile-info-font-size: 16px;
```

You can adjust any of these `px` values to your preferred font size.

### How can I change the fonts used?

To change the font family, open the `Styling` section of the card in Anki by going to `Browse`, then select a Lapis card and then click on `Cards` (top-left of the card editor). In the `Styling` section, look for the part labeled `/* Miscellaneous */`, and you will see this:

```css
  --font-serif: serif;
  --font-sans: sans-serif;
``` 

You can replace these with any fonts you prefer, or leave them as is to use the default fonts your operating system uses. If you want a recommendation, we like Hiragino fonts (the default on macOS) and Noto CJK fonts. If you see Chinese ideograms instead of Japanese kanji, read [this guide](https://learnjapanese.moe/font/). 

### I have a question not covered in the FAQ!

You can ask us a question by opening an issue on the [issue tracker](https://github.com/donkuri/lapis/issues).

### Will this work with tools like JL?

Technically, this should work without any issue with JL as it doesn't use any custom handlebars, but a setup guide is not currently provided. If you try it out, let us know! We will update this in due time.

### Additional thanks

#### kuri

I would like to thank everyone that has helped us here. Some have their names above because they have been major contributors, others simply encouraged us and told us what they would like to see in a new notetype. You know who you are!
I would also like to dedicate this project to Austin, I hope you are well my friend, thank you for your help, without you my work in the Japanese learning community would have never been a reality.

#### Ruri

I’d like to express my heartfelt thanks to everyone who made this notetype possible. First, a huge thank you to [Donkuri](https://github.com/donkuri/) for agreeing to collaborate with me on this project. I’ve learned so much thanks to you, and the notetype has improved far more than it ever could have without your help—thank you, truly, from the bottom of my heart.

Next, I’d like to thank [Rudnam](https://github.com/rudnam/), whose code laid the foundation for this project. Your clear, functional code made everything so much easier, and your entire logic code (with some modifications) is showcased in Lapis!

Finally, a big thank you to [Aquafina (Austin S.)](https://github.com/Aquafina-water-bottle) and [Arbyste](https://github.com/arbyste) for creating and maintaining JPMN, which inspired the UI for Lapis. Your work laid the groundwork for what this project has become.

Last but not least, there’s me, Ruri! I wrote the code (and spent countless hours troubleshooting when things didn’t work the way I expected). I’ve done my best to make the code clear and easy to understand for anyone who wants to contribute—so a big thanks in advance to those who do!
